											</header>
											<p>Birds are intertwined with human culture and our everyday experiences. They exist virtually wherever we go, from around the house to bustling cities to the remote wilderness. While it's common not to pay too much attention to the birds around us, taking a closer look at them is quite fascinating. Photographing birds is challenging and can be incredibly rewarding, especially when you capture that moment that is only seen for a fraction of a second by the naked eye.</p>

											</header> 
											<p>It's hard to come by a person who doesn't enjoy riding a bike at least every now and then. To a good chunk of the population, bike riding is not just a leisurely activity, but a main means of transportation. To another chunk of the population, biking is a hardcore hobby. Bicycles are much more than just a frame and a couple wheels; they are happiness machines. With that in mind, you can think of photographing bikes as photographing happiness.</p>

											</header>
											<p>Bonsai is a Japanese expression with deep history and meaning. Though bonsai literally translates to "tray planting," there is true art and joy to be found in growing and caring for these tiny trees. It takes years to train a bonsai into the shape you want, which takes lots of patience and precision. Photographing them requires these traits, as well. Just as you train a bonsai tree, you must practice calmness and precision to get the perfect shot.</p>
